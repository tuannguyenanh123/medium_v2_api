 - Typescript

## 2. What we will be implementing ?
- We will only build the backend using NestJS

## 3. Prerequisites
- Nodejs
- Follow docs nestjs
- Postman

## 4. Module, Controllers and providers
- Controllers are responsible for handling incoming request and outgoing

## 5. Build Tag Module

## 6. Create Tag Service

## 7. Configuring absolute path and the start script
- Use module-alias package for supporting absolute path for the JS files
- Configure paths in tsconfig.json file for supporting absolute path for the ts files
- `ts-node`: ts-node is a TypeScript execution engine and REPL for Node.js. And used for dev mode
- `tsconfig-paths`: Use this to load modules whose location is specified in the paths section of tsconfig.json
- Use nodemon package for using watch mode while starting server in dev
